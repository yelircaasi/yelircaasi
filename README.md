- 👋 Hi, I’m @yelircaasi, a developer with a background in machine learning and natural language processing.
- 🛠️ I'm the creator and maintainer of [RosettaProjects](https://github.com/RosettaProjects), a collection of resources for learning and comparing programming languages side-by-side.
- 👀 Aside from my work, I'm interested in type systems and compilers. FOSS is something I care a lot about.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Haskell. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to my interests, and my circle of interests is in constant flux.
